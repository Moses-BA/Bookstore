# Bookstore
A simple bookstore management system.

Purpose

This Java program simulates a bookstore. It allows users to browse the bookstore's inventory, purchase books, and search for books by author.

Usage

To run the program, simply compile and execute the Main class. The program will prompt the user for their name and then display a list of all the books in the bookstore. The user can then purchase a book by entering the title of the book. The program will then search the bookstore's inventory for the book and, if it is found, will sell it to the user. The user can also search for books by author by entering the author's name. The program will then search the bookstore's inventory for all the books written by that author and display a list of those books.

Example

The following is an example of how to use the program:

Notes(IMPORTANT):

The bookstore's inventory is hardcoded into the program. However, it would be relatively easy to modify the program to allow users to add and remove books from the inventory.
The program does not validate the user's input. It is important to make sure that the user enters valid data before running the program.
The program is only a simple example. It can be modified to meet your specific needs. For example, you could add additional features such as support for multiple currencies, shipping and handling fees, and customer reviews.
